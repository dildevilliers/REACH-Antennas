## Discussions
- John finishing up the 50 Ohm dipole design
    - Substantially larger than the previous version ~1.2 m arms
    - S_11 < -10 dB ~70 - 120 MHz
    - MATLAB parameters look okay
    - Will send to Brandt for balun design
    - Dominic busy with the pipeline runs
- Brandt discusses the 1/4 scale model
    - Idea to be able to build very quickly
    - Just scale a few things - not everything.  Dipole arms and ground plane, not the coax so we can take what we have in the lab.
- Nima sent some offline emails about the available cables. Going to bring 50 Ohm heliax to Stellenbosch
