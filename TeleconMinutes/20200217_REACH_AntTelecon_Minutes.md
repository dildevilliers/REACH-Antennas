# Minutes of Antennas Telecon
## Date: 2020-02-17
## Present:

## Discussions
- Dirk discusses the current progress with manufacturing: Antenna arms are complete, rest of stuff ordered and on the way
- There is a long discussion about Nima's simulations of the chromaticity FoM.  EDGES published results are consistanly lower than what we get.  John shows results using Brandt's code that looks better.  Cambridge team will discuss offline how to fix it.
- Discussion about antenna ground plane. Elevating GP could be very difficult, but so also levelling the ground.  Further discussion needed.
- RX box installation requires air cooling.  Mostly agreed that this could be done under ground.  Will need a strong support in the hole, with pipes to feed cooling air.

## Action Items
- Eloy and Dirk to engage with SKA site staff about ground work (levelling and trenching)
- Cambridge to sort out chromaticity simulations
- John still working on geometric variation modelling via CBFPs
- Dirk is getting quotes for ground mesh etc

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2020-03-02
- Geometric variation effects on the pattern
- TBD
- AoB
