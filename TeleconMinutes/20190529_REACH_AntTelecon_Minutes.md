## Discussions
- Brandt presents FoM status
    - MATLAB class essentially done
    - Still not sure of results, so comparisons using raw pattern and sky map data to be done
    - Aloy has provided patterns of the BowTie antenna: to be tested
- Long discussion about other FoM's
    - Not sure if absolute sky integral really needed for design, but it is still handy to estimate expected variation levels
    - Will include CBFP frequency variation as FoM. Do a CBFP over frequency of the pattern, and see with how few coefficients it can be reconstructed to a certain level of confidence

## Action Items
- Eloy to send pattern and sky map data for FoM development
- Brandt, Christos, Nima and Eloy to test FoM using the same data and different codes
- All people working on antennas to prepare 2 slides for round table at the next meeting

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-06-03
- Round table on current antenna options
- Plan the selection criteria details
- AOB
