## Discussions
- John did send Brandt a CST file - still TODO the balun
- Dominic is running the above CST model with a simple balun made by John. Goal is to check if the balun makes a difference in the field structure.
- Eloy mentions Dominic finds it is harder for a dipole than CLS to find the signal.
    - One reason is due to bandwidth
- John replies that dipoles are not fitting false signals, but not really finding real signals that well
- Eloy suggests to keep going ahead with building dipole
    - simple
    - close to EDGES for comparison
    - Dominic happy to have the dipole - not sure he'll detect anything, but not worried about getting a false signal

## Action Items
- John and Dominic send final dimensions early next week
- Brandt sorts out balun
- Dirk primes workshop to get things built as early as possible 
- Add option for connectors directly on the antenna - must be able to disconnect the balun
- Start thinking about the ground plane and ground preparation after:
    January site trip
    - Get final antenna position
    - RFI box position
    - Support container position
    - Power panels position
    - Figure out if we should put the RFI box under the panels?

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-12-09
- Final meeting for the year: Summary of TODO over Xmas
- AoB
