## Discussions
- RX:
    - Ian presents slides on pipeline status
    - Higher order polynomials in pipeline, works well up to order 5. 
    - Can retreive simulated data NW parameters to ~5K for TNS or 0.5K for rest (depending on sigma).
    - Quick test with real data produces about 2-3K residuals. Much better than before, so things looking optimistic.
    - Still busy figuring out best way to determine poly order for each NW parameter. Goal is to have each parameter with its best order (EDGES uses the same order for them all).
    - Once done, then measured data will be investigated.

    - Nima reports Cambridge labs might be open early next week...

- Antenna:
    - Dirk reports that antenna manufacturing coming along - some issues with PCB manufacturing licenses
    - John shows slides on new serrated prototype ground plane results: does not look too bad in S11.  Pattern TODO.
    - John still busy setting up a more formal optimization of the dipole.
    - Quentin waiting for lab to open.  Will do GP size simulation.
    
## Action Items
- Nima will put together very rough timeline on RX box.
- Dirk will hopefully measure first prototype antenna.
