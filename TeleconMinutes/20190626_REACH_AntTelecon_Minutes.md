## Discussions
- Brandt shares FoM slides
- Waterfall plots between Brandt and Nima compares well.  Must be careful about the spectral index to get details right.
- CBFP modelling results look promising
- Suggestion to also add geometric variation CBFP's to the base set to improve chances of getting very accurate measured results.
- Brandt and Cambridge team will compare simulated CBFP results to measurements taken at Lord's bridge 

## Action Items
- Waterfall plot cuts to be shared between Brandt, Nima and Eloy for proper comparison
- Brandt cleans code, and start formal comparisons between different antennas

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-07-01
- Discussion of antenna element performance according to FoMs
- Eloy to host (Dirk travelling)
