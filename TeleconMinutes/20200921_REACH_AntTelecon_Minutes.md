## Discussions
- RX:
    - Nima gives short overview of block diagram of RX system
    - Steve discusses current progress. Busy with temp sensors and control.
    - Still having issues with COVID-19 restrictions to get things built in the UK
    - Will do tests on the available Peltier power/efficiency to formally see what cooling can be achieved

    - There are some issues with spectral dips due to FFT.  Riccardo considering floating point FFT, but this will fix us at 2 antennas in the system

    - Will reports calibration routines looking good with simulated data, and will write up something to arxiv level soon.
    - Consider some raydome for the antenna to stop temp/winde/sunlight variations

- Antenna:
    - Dirk shows initial prototype measurement results
    - Will post more pictures on slack etc
    - Will follow up with John Cumner to make proper simulation model
    - Will write a little memo on the measurements
    
## Action Items
- Ian will make some slides showing the calibration performance
- Dirk will write memo on antenna prototype measurement
- Dirk to take many antenna measurements for S11 time variation

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2020-10-05
