## Discussions
- Nafsika presents EBG work
    - First antenna over ground plane simulations shwon
    - Still some uncertainty since results not great. GP possibly too small.
- Nicolas presents several antenna simulation results
    - Fat vivaldi
    - Dual-ridge horn
    - Both look promising, but ground plane reflections still have a significant effect on the pattern and must be characterised
- John discusses spiral antenna results
    - Similar to last week (simulations correct at least)
    - Sinuous antenna (conical) also looks good, but feed details to be sorted out still
- Brandt presents FoM status
    - MATLAB class essentially done
    - Still not sure of results, so comparisons using raw pattern and sky map data to be done

## Action Items
- Eloy to send pattern and sky map data for FoM development
- Brandt, Christos, Nima and Eloy to test FoM using the same data and different codes

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-05-29 (Wednesday)
- Brandt feedback on FoM implementation and code deployment
- Cambridge antenna feedback
- Discuss ICEAA papers
- AOB
