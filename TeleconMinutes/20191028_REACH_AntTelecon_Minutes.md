## Discussions
- Eloy and Dominic presents pipeline simulation results
- CLS: Looks like the 6/7 m system works best
- Must decide on the balun:
    - Circuit balun: Pro the interface, con the model uncertainty
    - Balun in box: Pro can possibly temperature control it better, con the predictability of the long differential line,  
- John is optimizing dipoles for 50 Ohm
- Pipeline shows that the dipoles detect better in the regions where they are actually not designed for.  Working theory is that the foreground fitting is done in the band where the dipole works well.
- Brandt presents balun results for the dipoles

## Action Items
- John finish 50 ohm designs
- Brandt designs baluns for those

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-11-04
- Try to freeze designs of the antennas
- Try to freeze the baluns
- Discuss manufacturing process
- AoB
