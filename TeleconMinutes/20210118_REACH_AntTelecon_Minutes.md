## Discussions
- RX:
    - RX system calibration development nearly done in simulation
    - Next step is really practical implementation
    - Nima shows RX system simulation
    - Several components already built - few left ToDo

- RFI flagging:
    - Alec presents some slides on broad RFI flagging strategy


- Antenna:
    - Some discussion on max|S11|. Nima and Richard makes the point that better S11 is better for calibration and we need a balance between that level and chromaticity.
    - Still some work to do to understand the tradeoff properly here.
