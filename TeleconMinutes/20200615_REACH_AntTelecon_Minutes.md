## Discussions
- Dirk confirms Stellenbosch is busy opening up. Should be able to return to labs and workshops within a week or two.
- Cambridge in similar situation
- Jean confirms his MoM simulations are getting much closer to the CST simulations.
- Jean will soon start simulations with more realistic soil - including cases where we use layered media
- John is still busy with antenna modelling simulations.  There is still some noise, which was reduced by smoothing the pattern.  Still busy.
- Quentin slowly starting up log-spiral work
    - Building started before lockdown
    - Plan to order and test several commercial baluns
    - Will also make several by hand and compare. Nima gave advice on checking for examples from radio amateurs
- Ian gave a bit of feedback on calibration work. Recently much progress was made on improving the results for frequency dependent noise wave parameters.  Still some bugs to find in the code.
- Thermal cooling work:
    - John (E) started initial work on node cooling
    - Steve finalising RX box cooling.
        - Confident that we will have enough cooling power to remove heat for a 13 degree differential.  Needs about 90 W DC power
        - Still not sure of exact temperature distribution on the cooling plate

## Action Items
- Dirk to set up smaller group to discuss interfaces and power in the system

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2020-06-29 
- AoB
