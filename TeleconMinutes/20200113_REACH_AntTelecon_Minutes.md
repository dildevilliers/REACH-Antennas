## Discussions
- Dirk discusses the current progress with manufacturing
- Antenna feed bridge board will have a version with SMA connectors to measure the antenna with no balun
- Careful thought should go into the hole (or platform as second option).  Hole should include some pipes to feed air and cables, and the hole walls must be made stable with a large diameter pipe or similar.
- N-type connector will be used for interface between antenna and receiver box.
- Location requirements:
    - Central spot for node and solar panels
    - Three equilateral positions for antennas
    - Each antenna position should ideally have a 50m radius for ground plane (this might be a bit much, but we should try)
    - Mark these with stakes and rope
- Design and pipeline work will continue once antenna is measured.  John will do some ground plane size simulations in the meantime.

## Action Items
- Start thinking about the ground plane and ground preparation after:
    January site trip
    - Get final antenna position
    - RFI box position
    - Support container position
    - Power panels position
    - Figure out if we should put the RFI box under the panels?

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2020-01-20
- Feedback on manufacturing
- Feedback on site trip
- AoB
