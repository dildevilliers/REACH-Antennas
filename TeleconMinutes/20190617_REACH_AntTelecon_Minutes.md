## Discussions
- John gives feedback of the Sinuous antenna
    - Impedance can be flat, but it affects the pattern
    - Not sure how to quantify, so details will emerge with the final FoM
    - Parameters for tuning ID'd
    - Same situation with the elliptical dipole
- Long discussion on system impedance and use of baluns. Nima feels strongly one should be careful of baluns which are hard to characterise. Keep to 50 Ohm coax if possible, since all the calibration standards/switches are that...
- Eman discusses the horn results
    - Added a cavity in the WG, and as expected, S11 influenced 
    - Will show slides next week
    - Dirk will send Eman some papers about te SKA/MeerKAT horns
- Nicolas gives some feedback on HERA type feed, dropped into the ground
    - Similar to John's results - need the FoM code to really know what is happening
    - Still needs to include the full soil situation in the simulations
- Nima gives some details about the receiver box interface. Connector outside can be moved a bit to accommodate the antenna.
- Nafsika gives results about the defected ground plane simulations
    - Much better results now obtained for 7x7 and 5x5 plane
    - Some discussion about available material, Nafsika will follow up
    - Nima suggests maybe using ferrites close in to the antenna. Expensive, but using only close in can help and be affordable.

## Action Items
- Dirk emails papers to Eman
- Dirk migrates the repo to the wiki 

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-06-24
- Discussion on Brandt/Jean visit
- FoM code integration
- First prototype down selection plan
- Schedule ad-hoc telecon?
- AoB
