## Discussions
- Inverted Sinious (John)
		- Eloy: 
			action on John: too many arms? Less arms would be smoother.
			action on John: load arms
			100 Ohm?
			Increase gain resolution in plots
			Good beams 
		- Brandt:
			what is alpha? tao? action on John: optimise these.

	- Elliptical dipole (John)
		- Eloy:
			S11 smooth and gain but narrower band
			action on John: optimise ellipticity
			action on John: optimise height wrt and plane
			action on John: slots for improvement?
			action on John: introduce angle in arms as in the sinuous or blue antenna

	- Monopole (John)
		- Like SARAS antenna
		- RFI would be an issue due to beam at horizon
		- No more work for the moment

	- Conical log-spiral (Quentin, presented by John)
		- Very good S11
		- action on Quentin: try shorter transmission line?
		- Ripples in gain due to gnd plane? action on Quentin: optimise
		- action on Quentin: load arms

	- Tongue  (Quentin, presented by John)
		- Quentin to report next time

	- Horn (QRH/Vivaldi) (Nicolas)
		- Different versions with ground plane at the antenna level or below
		- action on Nicolas: Try a smoother profile from antenna to coplanar and plane. 
		- action on Nicolas: Add soil outside gas plane
		- action on Nicolas: add serrations
		- action on Nicolas: optimise opening rate of aperture
		- action on Nicolas: Try larger horn

	- Corrugated Horn (Eman)
		- Good S11
		- Ripples in gain due to gnd plane
		- action on Eman: try bigger height (currently 1.1 m)
		- action on Eman: add cavity bering antenna feed point
