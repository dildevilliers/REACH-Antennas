## Discussions
- Guest instrument application approved
- Long discussion about the pros and cons of the conical log spiral.  Decide to go ahead, build it and measure to see waht we get.  Should keep the issues of reflections along lines with length corresponding to the EoR signal frequency carefully in mind.
- Will also go ahead with the dipole.  Final version TBD.
- Will go to more exotic ideas, like rotating antennas, in version 2 when we have some more idea of how the first versions perform
- Will extend the modelling framework for the antennas once the first prototypes are made

## Action Items
- Quentin trying to reduce the size of the CLS antenna
- Brandt starts work on a balun for the dipole with John

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-09-30 (bank holiday on 08/26)
- Discuss CLS progress
- Discuss the dipole balun progress
- Discuss path forward - specifically timeline for deployment
- AoB
