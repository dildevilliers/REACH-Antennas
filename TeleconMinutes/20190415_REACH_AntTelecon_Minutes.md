# Minutes of Antennas Telecon
## Date: 20190415
## Present: 
- [x] Dirk de Villiers
- [ ] Brandt Klopper
- [ ] Eloy de Lera Acedo
- [x] Nima Razavi
- [ ] Nicolas Fagnoni

## Discussions
- John presents some slides on antenna simulations being performed at Cambridge
    - Elliptical dipole
    - Planar spiral
    - SARAS2 monopole
    - Conical log-spiral
    - Cavity-backed spiral
- Discussions follow, where Nima mentions one might consider dishes if they are cheap enough.  Essentially modify the large ground plane
- Christophe presents some work on Tongue type antennas which look promising with simple feeds and broad band smooth performance
- Dirk shows some RFI application antennas that another student at Stellenbosch is working on
- Short discussion on spoil models.  Hardie Pienaar does not have more information at low frequencies, but Christophe forwards a paper on broad-band soil electrical property modellig

## Action Items
- Dirk will prepare a timeline document - will be open for comments and revision
- Stellenbosch continues implementing FOM for antenna beams
- Cambridge continues antenna element modelling
- Jean will find some more information on the Tongue type antennas.  Someone needs to build simulation models (Brandt/Cambdridge)

## Next Agenda
- No meeting on Easter Monday
- Next meeting 20190429
- Brandt feedback on FoM implementation
- Cambridge feedback on element simulations
- Christophe gives feedback on soil simulation and modelling
- Jean/Christophe feedback on Tongue antennas
- Timeline: Discuss the Karoo and Lord's Bridge prototypes and deployment goals and system requirements
- Repo/Wiki access
- AOB
