## Discussions
- Quentin shows slides about the CLS antenna for different sizes.  Obviously the bigger ones show more chromatic effects.  How this links to the final detection is unsure. 
- Looks like smaller ones will be easier to model, but larger ones might perform better
- Dominic is running a large set of antennas through the pipeline to find out.
- Eloy discusses options to manufacture the CLS and dipole.  Poles with holes for CLS, and table for dipole
- Brandt and Joh discuss current dipole models - they seem to be for 100 Ohms.  John designed them for good patterns and not S11.
- Dirk discusses basics of the Robert's balun work for the dipole

## Action Items
- Dominic running pipeline sims for several antennas
- Quentin working with Dominic on the pipeline results
- John sorting out impedance of the dipoles
- Brandt to design 1st 2nd and 3rd order baluns to show the difference in performance and complexity for the dipoles (50 and 100 Ohm maybe?)
- Dirk will discuss the manufacture with local team after next call

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-10-07
- Discuss CLS progress
- Discuss the dipole balun progress
- Discuss path forward - specifically timeline for deployment
- AoB
