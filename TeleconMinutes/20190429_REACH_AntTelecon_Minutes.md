## Discussions
- Brandt presents the FoM results as they stand:
    - Fixing sky map and rotating antenna pattern over time
    - Shows plots of an antenna pattern on an astronomical coordinate system as a function of time
    - Shows sky maps in different coordinate systems
    - Can read FEKO/CST farfield patterns
- Eloy gives some feedback on Tongue antenna simulations.  Looks promising...
- Iman gives feedback on Horn antenna simulations.  Structures large, but this is expected.  Could be an option since a smaller ground plane will be needed.
- Nafsika gives feedback on EBG simulations.  Currently the substrate is too thick, but will look into reducing permittivity to free space.  Christos gives advice to try impedance sheet boundary condition first before detail design.
- Discussion on deployment timeline.  Still on target for first antenna review in June, and deployment in August. Nima thinks we could have a basic monitoring system ready for August deployment - will add to GI application

## Action Items
- Brandt continues implementing FOM for antenna beams - deployment target next Monday
- Cambridge continues antenna element modelling
- Quentin can email round some results of the Tongue antenna simulations
- Dirk will prepare a timeline document - will be open for comments and revision

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-05-06
- Brandt feedback on FoM implementation and code deployment
- Cambridge feedback on element simulations
- Christophe gives feedback on soil simulation and modelling
- Feedback on timeline
- AOB
