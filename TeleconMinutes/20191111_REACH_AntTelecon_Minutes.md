## Discussions
- Brandt is nearly finished with the 1/4 scale model.  Hope to measure this week.
- Nima mentioned Heliax cable is in SA for collection from Hardie to incorporate into the dipole designs
- Nima also suggests to optimize the antenna with balun before we make it.  Good idea, but leads to following discussion:
- Long discussion about dipole performance
    - Looks like the 50 Ohm version of John does not do well in the pipeline
    - John and Dominic trying to find something closer to 50 Ohms that does well in the pipeline simulations
    - Brandt will send John a version of the 100 Ohm antenna with a balun, to see if the balun breaks the radiation performance
    - Dipole pipeline performance remains very difficult to predict before the fact
    - Looks like the conical log spiral still does well in most cases
- Quentin discusses CLS progress
    - Busy optimising antennas with different coil-craft baluns - need to match the antenna to the balun
    - Baluns are lossy, so several will be purchased and measured to try to characterize the spectral behaviour of the loss
    - Substantially larger than the previous version ~1.2 m arms
- Dirk mentioned that timeline becoming too tight to finish both prototype antennas this year. Plan is to try to get the dipole done, the CLS design done, and the CLS made next year.
    
## Action Items
- John and Dominic busy with lower impedance dipoles that does well in the pipeline
- Brandt will send John a model of the 100 Ohm dipole with balun
- Brand prepares and measures the 1/4 scale model
- Dirk will set up infrastructure panel soon - when Eloy and Nima are back in the UK in the week of the 18th

## Next Agenda
- Next meeting 2019-11-18
- Try to freeze designs of the dipole antenna
- Discuss manufacturing process
- Discuss the CLS balun design progress
- AoB
